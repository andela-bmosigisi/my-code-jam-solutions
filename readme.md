Greetings internet

I have decided to share some of my solutions for past problems on google code jam. Each folder is fairly descriptive if you are familiar with google's annual code jam. Apart from the java file and sample input and output files, each folder contains a html file which has the algorithm in question.

Prerequisite: 

- JavaSE (Configured in your environment variables).
- General enthusiasm for code.

In order to run a certain solution:

a) Navigate to the folder of the particular solution.
b) Identify the .java file e.g MinimumScalar.java
c) Since a class file already exists, you do not need to generate it. Therefore run:

	java MinimumScalar

d) Voila.
