**Google code jam solutions**

These are some of my solutions for past problems on google code jam. Each folder is fairly descriptive if you are familiar with google's annual code jam. Apart from the java file and sample input and output files, each folder contains a markdown file with the link to the past contest page, where the outputs can be uploaded.
The folders all contain practice solutions apart from Code Jam 2014, which I participated in.

Prerequisite:

- JavaSE (Configured in your environment variables).

In order to run a certain solution:

a) Navigate to the folder of the particular solution.
b) Identify the .java file e.g MinimumScalar.java
c) Since a class file already exists, you do not need to generate it. Therefore run:

	java MinimumScalar

d) The above command should generate an output file, uploadable to the respective pages.
